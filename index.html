  <h1>Biddlr</h1>
  <p>Biddlr is an application to create a marketplace ofr workers \
    to complete projects involving unskilled labor at the lowest \
    prices for job posters. Moreover, employers can set a maximum \
    price they will accept before the bidding process begins. Also, \
    job posters can choose not to accept the lowest bid and instead \
    go with a higher bid that has a higher satisfaction rating. In \
    addition, bidders can only bid the prices that they are willing \
    to work for. Furthermore the application will create opportunity \
    to build work credibility for non-professionals. There will be a \
    service fee taken from the job poster, not bidders. Also, biddlr \
    will simplify the searching process by using geographical \
    proximity. In addition, the app will reinforce trust between job \
    poster and job bidder with a rating process.</p>
