  <h1>Biddlr</h1>
  <p>Biddlr is an application to create a marketplace ofr workers
    to complete projects involving unskilled labor at the lowest
    prices for job posters. Moreover, employers can set a maximum
    price they will accept before the bidding process begins. Also,
    job posters can choose not to accept the lowest bid and instead
    go with a higher bid that has a higher satisfaction rating. In
    addition, bidders can only bid the prices that they are willing
    to work for. Furthermore the application will create opportunity
    to build work credibility for non-professionals. There will be a
    service fee taken from the job poster, not bidders. Also, biddlr
    will simplify the searching process by using geographical
    proximity. In addition, the app will reinforce trust between job
    poster and job bidder with a rating process.</p>
